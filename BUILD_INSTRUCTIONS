Solaris X Window System Consolidation Build Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------

== Build requirements & preparation ==

To build X, you need to set up a machine with the correct build environment:
 - A machine running a recent build of the target version of Solaris,
   with the IPS package developer/opensolaris/X installed. This meta-package
   ensures all the other packages in Solaris which are needed to build X are
   installed.
 - The current Solaris Common Build Environment (CBE) version of the
   Oracle Solaris Studio C & C++ compilers & associated tools.
   These must be found first for cc/CC/etc. in $PATH when you build, and
   must include at least these packages (or their equivalents):
        developer/solarisstudio-124/backend
        developer/solarisstudio-124/c++
        developer/solarisstudio-124/cc
        developer/solarisstudio-124/dmake
        developer/solarisstudio-124/library/c++-libs

There are several options that may be configured when building this software,
such as whether to use tools & servers internal to Oracle's network or not.
Before you build the software for the first time, you will need to ensure
these options are correctly set for you - see the section titled
"Setting builder/distro variables" in open-src/README for a list of these
settings and instructions to configure open-src/common/Makefile.options.

== Building the software ==

To build the software, simply cd into the top level directory and run

 ./buildit

To build the software and create packages, add the -p flag to buildit:

 ./buildit -p

Output of various stages is stored into log files which you can check for
errors with the included open-src/util/build-tools/find-build-errors script:

build step      files under log/ directory in build tree
----------      ----------------------------------------
Software build  buildit-XW, check-rtime
IPS packaging   make-pkgs, check-pkgs

The built binaries are found after the build in a proto area:

SPARC           proto/root_sparc/
x86/x64         proto/root_i386/

The file open-src/README has further details on the build system and
directory organizaiton of this software repository.

== Installing IPS packages ==

The built packages will be found in a repository in the directory
proto/pkg_sparc or proto/pkg_i386 as appropriate.

Builds made by individual developers default to using the publisher
name "nightly" but that can be overridden via flags to the buildit or
make_release_packages scripts.  They will depend on the versions of
packages from other consolidations that were installed on the system
they built them on.

The recommended mechanism for installing any of these builds is the onu
tool provided by ON. You can install the pkg:/developer/build/onbld package
to get a local copy installed as /opt/onbld/bin/onu .

onu will create a new boot environment and install the packages there - you
will then need to reboot into that BE to use them.

Note that onu uses pkg update, which means there are two important
things to remember:

1) It will upgrade all of your packages and not just the X packages.
2) It will normally only upgrade the X packages you already have installed
   on the system, though it will leave the BE mounted so that you can add
   other packages via pkg -R /tmp/onu.* install package-name.

Example: Install to a new BE named "X14" that is cloned from the current BE:

 # onu -O -u file://`pwd`/proto/pkgs_i386 -U nightly -t X14
