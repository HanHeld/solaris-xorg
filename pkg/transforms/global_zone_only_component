#
# For packagers:
#
# This ruleset is useful for "system" components-- ones which are expected
# to appear primarily in the global zone, but which may have some small
# pieces (man pages, header files) which may need to appear in all zones.
#
# The current rules specify that all payload-bearing actions (file,
# dir, hardlink, link) should appear *only* in the global zone, with
# the following exceptions:
#
# 	- man pages appear in all zones
# 	- header files appear in all zones
# 	- mdb(1) modules appear in all zones
#
# You may well have other actions which you wish to appear in all zones.
# An example would be an administrative utility for a driver which has
# been virtualized to work within zones.  For those actions you wish to
# appear in all zones, add the following attribute to your action.
#
#         variant.opensolaris.zone=__NODEFAULT
#
# You DO NOT need to specify __NODEFAULT for man pages, headers, or
# mdb modules, as those are covered by the automatic rules below.
#
# Note: When you specify variant.opensolaris.zone=__NODEFAULT, the
# net effect is that *no* variant.opensolaris.zone attribute will
# appear in the post-processed manifest.
#

#
# For packaging nerds:
#
# We have a problem to solve here: To make an action appear in all zones,
# it should have *no* variant.opensolaris.zone attribute.  So it's a bit
# more complicated to use "default".
#
# Here's what we do: we use "default" to set all payload bearing actions
# which have no variant.opensolaris.zone attribute to be
# variant.opensolaris.zone=global.  For those actions which need to appear
# in all zones, the packager must specify
# variant.opensolaris.zone=__NODEFAULT.  Additionally we have some rules
# which set __NODEFAULT for a few classes of well known things, like man
# pages and headers.
#
# We then go through and clean up all of the __NODEFAULTed attributes by
# simply deleting them.
# 

# Man pages should appear in all zones.
<transform dir file link hardlink path=.*/man/.* -> default variant.opensolaris.zone __NODEFAULT>
<transform dir path=.*/man$ -> default variant.opensolaris.zone __NODEFAULT>

# Headers should appear in all zones.
<transform dir file link hardlink path=.*/include/.* -> default variant.opensolaris.zone __NODEFAULT>
<transform dir path=.*/include$ -> default variant.opensolaris.zone __NODEFAULT>

# MDB modules should appear in all zones, as one might debug a crash dump
# in a zone.
<transform dir file link hardlink path=.*/mdb/.* -> default variant.opensolaris.zone __NODEFAULT>
<transform dir path=.*/mdb$ -> default variant.opensolaris.zone __NODEFAULT>

# Everything else is global zone only unless the user overrides
# action-by-action with __NODEFAULT.
<transform dir file link hardlink -> default variant.opensolaris.zone global>

#
# Buff out the __NODEFAULT attributes. 
#
<transform dir file link hardlink -> delete variant.opensolaris.zone __NODEFAULT>
